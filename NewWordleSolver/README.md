WORDLE ENTROPY SOLVER (C) - PROJECT OVERVIEWThis project implements a highly optimized solver for the 5-letter word game Wordle, written entirely in C. It employs an information-theoretic approach to find the mathematically best next guess.CORE STRATEGYThe solver's decision-making process balances two critical metrics:SHANNON ENTROPY (H): Maximizes the average information gain to reduce the set of possible answers most efficiently.WORD RANK (R): Measures word frequency (000-100, where 100 is most common). R is used as a tie-breaker when Entropy scores are similar, or as the primary metric when the remaining solution space is small (fewer than 25 words).LINGUISTIC FILTERSThe solver includes a strong linguistic filtering layer to ensure recommendations match common Wordle answers, explicitly excluding:Plural Nouns (ending in 'S', etc.)Past Tense Verbs3rd Person Singular VerbsCOMPILATION AND DEPENDENCIESDependenciesThis project requires the cURL library for downloading the list of past Wordle answers from the web.Input DataThe solver relies on a proprietary local file for frequency and linguistic data:File: AllWords.txtLocation: The path is currently hardcoded in wordle_solver.c (C:\VS22.Projects\StuffForWordle\WordleWordsCSVs\AllWords.txt).Format: Each line must be 10 characters: [5-Letter Word][3-Digit Rank][Noun Type][Verb Type]Build InstructionsEnsure you have a C compiler and the cURL library configured.Compile wordle_solver.c and link against the cURL library (-lcurl).Run the compiled executable. The program will prompt you for your guess and the resulting G/Y/B pattern for each turn.
